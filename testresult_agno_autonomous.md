Use the linkedin_scraper_tool from the SalesToolkit to find potential companies or people based on the user\'s request (industry, roles, location). You might need multiple searches.\n- 2. Use the organize_information_tool from the SalesToolkit to process the raw scraped data and extract a structured list of contacts matching the user\'s target roles.\n- 3. For each contact found and organized, use the generate_email_tool from the SalesToolkit to draft a personalized email based on the contact\'s details and the user\'s profile/purpose.\n- 4. Present the final drafted emails as your result. If multiple emails are generated, provide them as a list of JSON objects.\n- Think step-by-step using the ReasoningTools to plan your actions.\n- Ensure all necessary information (like user profile details) is passed correctly to the tools.\n</instructions>\n\n<reasoning_instructions>\nYou have access to the `think` and `analyze` tools to work through problems step-by-step and structure your thought process. You must ALWAYS `think` before making tool calls or generating a response.\n\n1. **Think** (scratchpad):\n    - Purpose: Use the `think` tool as a scratchpad to break down complex problems, outline steps, and decide on immediate actions within your reasoning flow. Use this to structure your internal monologue.\n    - Usage: Call `think` before making tool calls or generating a response. Explain your reasoning and specify the intended action (e.g., "make a tool call", "perform calculation", "ask clarifying question").\n\n2. **Analyze** (evaluation):\n    - Purpose: Evaluate the result of a think step or a set of tool calls. Assess if the result is expected, sufficient, or requires further investigation.\n    - Usage: Call `analyze` after a set of tool calls. Determine the `next_action` based on your analysis: `continue` (more reasoning needed), `validate` (seek external confirmation/validation if possible), or `final_answer` (ready to conclude).\n    - Explain your reasoning highlighting whether the result is correct/sufficient.\n\n## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES\n- **Always Think First:** You MUST use the `think` tool before making tool calls or generating a response.\n- **Iterate to Solve:** Use the `think` and `analyze` tools iteratively to build a clear reasoning path. The typical flow is `Think` -> [`Tool Calls` if needed] -> [`Analyze` if needed] -> ... -> `final_answer`. Repeat this cycle until you reach a satisfactory conclusion.\n- **Make multiple tool calls in parallel:** After a `think` step, you can make multiple tool calls in parallel.\n- **Keep Thoughts Internal:** The reasoning steps (thoughts and analyses) are for your internal process only. Do not share them directly with the user.\n- **Conclude Clearly:** When your analysis determines the `next_action` is `final_answer`, provide a concise and accurate final answer to the user.\n</reasoning_instructions>', name=None, tool_call_id=None, tool_calls=None, audio=None, images=None, videos=None, files=None, audio_output=None, image_output=None, thinking=None, redacted_thinking=None, provider_data=None, citations=None, reasoning_content=None, tool_name=None, tool_args=None, tool_call_error=None, stop_after_tool_call=False, add_to_agent_memory=True, from_history=False, metrics=MessageMetrics(input_tokens=0, output_tokens=0, total_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, input_audio_tokens=0, output_audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens_details=None, completion_tokens_details=None, additional_metrics=None, time=None, time_to_first_token=None, timer=None), references=None, created_at=1745713105), Message(role='user', content="\n        Start the sales outreach workflow for the following user profile:\n        - Target Industry: Healthcare AI\n        - Target Roles: ['CEO', 'Chief Technology Officer']\n        - Location: Bay Area\n        - Email Purpose: Exploring potential partnership opportunities for our new AI diagnostic platform.\n        - User Profile Dict (for email tool): {'uid': 'test_user', 'step': 'CONTEXT', 'profile': {'target_industry': None, 'target_roles': [], 'location': None, 'email_purpose': None, 'other_notes': None}, 'company_feedback': None, 'found_companies': [], 'contact_feedback': None, 'found_contacts': [], 'current_email_contact_index': 0, 'drafted_emails': {}, 'email_feedback': None, 'target_industry': 'Healthcare AI', 'target_roles': ['CEO', 'Chief Technology Officer'], 'location': 'Bay Area', 'email_purpose': 'Exploring potential partnership opportunities for our new AI diagnostic platform.'}\n\n        Find relevant contacts matching these criteria and draft personalized outreach emails for them.\n        ", name=None, tool_call_id=None, tool_calls=None, audio=None, images=None, videos=None, files=None, audio_output=None, image_output=None, thinking=None, redacted_thinking=None, provider_data=None, citations=None, reasoning_content=None, tool_name=None, tool_args=None, tool_call_error=None, stop_after_tool_call=False, add_to_agent_memory=True, from_history=False, metrics=MessageMetrics(input_tokens=0, output_tokens=0, total_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, input_audio_tokens=0, output_audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=0, prompt_tokens=0, completion_tokens=0, prompt_tokens_details=None, completion_tokens_details=None, additional_metrics=None, time=None, time_to_first_token=None, timer=None), references=None, created_at=1745713105), Message(role='assistant', content=None, name=None, tool_call_id=None, tool_calls=[{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'think', 'arguments': '{"title": "Initial Step: Data Gathering and Planning", "action": "Make tool call to linkedin_scraper_tool and organize_information_tool, then generate_email_tool.", "thought": "The user wants me to find relevant contacts in the Healthcare AI industry, specifically CEOs and CTOs in the Bay Area, and then draft personalized emails to them about potential partnership opportunities.
